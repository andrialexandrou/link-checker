# Link Checker

This bookmarklet makes it easy for one to review the accessibility of links on a page.

The goal of this bookmarklet is NOT to find every issue for you. In fact, that is impossible because assessing accessibility and usability always requires human judgement.

This tool will simply assist you by providing a consolidated view, things to look out for, and potential flags.

<b>A human (you) should be making the final judgment call!!!</b>

## Setup

Simply grab the bookmarklet at [khiga8.github.io/link-checker](https://khiga8.github.io/link-checker/).

## Features

When activated, it will open a new tab with a report of all links on the specified page. This report includes a table with a column that surfaces the accessible name, the visible label, as well potential issues detected by automated checks. In addition to reviewing the flagged issues, always use your human judgment to assess the accessibility of the links.

## Bug?

If you encounter a bug, please file a ticket. Contributions welcome.
