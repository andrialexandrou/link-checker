# Link Checker

WORK IN PROGRESS!

This bookmarklet makes it easy for one to review the accessibility of links on a page by providing a consolidated view and analysis of all the links on a given page.

When activated, it will open a new tab with a report.

This report includes a table with a column that surfaces the accessible name, the visible label, as well potential issues detected by automated checks. In addition to reviewing the flagged issues, always use your human judgment to assess the accessibility of the links.

## Setup

Grab the bookmarklet at [khiga8.github.io/link-checker](https://khiga8.github.io/link-checker/).
