# Link Checker

WIP

This bookmarklet makes it easy for one to review the accessibility of links on a page.

When activated, it will open a new tab with a report of all links on the specified page. This report includes a table with a column that surfaces the accessible name, the visible label, as well potential issues detected by automated checks. In addition to reviewing the flagged issues, always use your human judgment to assess the accessibility of the links.

## Setup

Grab the bookmarklet at [khiga8.github.io/link-checker](https://khiga8.github.io/link-checker/).
