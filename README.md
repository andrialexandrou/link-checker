# Link Checker

WORK IN PROGRESS!

This is a bookmarklet that generates a report of all the links on a given page. When activated, it will open a new window with a report that allows one to more easily assess the accessibility of links on the page. This report includes a table with a column that surfaces the visible label, accessible name, as well potential issues detected by automated checks.

Notably, a large part of determining accessibility relies on human judgment. This bookmarklet makes it easy for one to review the link texts on a page by providing a consolidated view of link attributes alongside guidance on what to assess.
